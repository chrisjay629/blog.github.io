adjective<br>
	1. deprived of the power of sensation.<br>

verb<br>
	1. deprived of feeling or responsiveness.<br><br>


  This is a word that could exclusively define the emotionless void I have towards tragedy and/or tragic events.  Nearly all of us share a common feeling when faced with tragedy.  We cry and get angry at these situations, and in some cases, stopping everything to dwell in sorrow and think at this very moment, life might actually be over. A feeling we can all sympathize with.  A feeling that is expected of us and not ever questioned, but simply understood.  <br><br>

This brings me to NUMB. It’s how I feel towards your pain, your life struggles, your heartbreaks, the loss of a family member, and anything else that might give you despair but not purposely. It is not my intention to be disrespectful towards you as much as it is that I am NUMB to you. <br><br>

I want to cry with you , and at the same time feel petty and remorse for my actions.  I want to care about my nonexistent relationship with my family , but NUMB won’t let me. It's as if she has an invisible cloak over me that shields me from all your tragedy and with all of this said I want to feel you’re pain.<br><br>

I wonder, has emotion escaped me?  Am I dead inside or has the wizard equipped me with an inverted heart carved out of stone ?  This is a question I constantly ask myself . <br><br>
